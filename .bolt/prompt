# RxSpot - Pharmacy Stock Tracker MVP

Build a mobile-first real-time pharmacy inventory tracker with:

## üó∫Ô∏è **Core Features**
1. **Interactive Map** (Leaflet.js) showing pharmacies within 25mi of user location
2. **One-tap Reporting**: Click pharmacy marker ‚Üí select medication ‚Üí tap "In Stock"/"Out of Stock" 
3. **Real-time Updates**: Color-coded markers update instantly (üü¢=in-stock, üî¥=out-of-stock, ‚ö™=unknown)
4. **Anonymous Usage**: No signup required - uses device fingerprint for user tracking

## üóÑÔ∏è **Supabase Integration**
Setup 3 tables with real-time subscriptions:

```sql
-- pharmacies table
id (uuid), name (text), address (text), lat (decimal), lng (decimal), phone (text)

-- medications table  
id (uuid), name (text), generic_name (text), common_shortage (boolean)

-- reports table
id (uuid), pharmacy_id (uuid), medication_id (uuid), 
status (text: 'in_stock'|'out_of_stock'), 
user_hash (text), confidence (decimal default 1.0), 
created_at (timestamp)
```

## üß† **Smart Confidence System**
- New reports start at confidence = 1.0
- **Time decay**: confidence -= 0.15 daily (24hr lifecycle)
- **Conflict resolution**: When conflicting reports ‚Üí `new_confidence = (old * 0.6) + (new * 0.4)`
- **Display logic**: Only show status if confidence > 0.3

## üéØ **Key Components**
1. **MapView**: Leaflet map with custom pharmacy markers
2. **PharmacyModal**: Popup showing pharmacy details + medication selector + report buttons
3. **MedicationSearch**: Autocomplete search (pre-loaded: Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Concerta, Ritalin, Strattera)
4. **ReportButton**: Large mobile-friendly "In Stock" / "Out of Stock" buttons
5. **StatusBadge**: Shows last update time + confidence indicator
6. **LiveNotifications**: Toast alerts for real-time updates

## üì± **User Experience**
- **Landing**: Auto-detect location ‚Üí show map with nearby pharmacies
- **Search**: Type medication name ‚Üí map filters to relevant reports
- **Report Flow**: Tap marker ‚Üí select medication ‚Üí tap status ‚Üí instant map update
- **Anonymous ID**: Generate persistent user_hash: `btoa(navigator.userAgent + Date.now()).slice(0,12)`

## üå± **Seed Data**
Pre-populate with 15 pharmacies in Austin, TX area:
- CVS, Walgreens, HEB, Walmart, Target locations with real addresses
- 8 common ADHD medications with shortage flags
- Mix of recent reports showing different confidence levels

## üé® **Mobile-First UI**
- **Primary colors**: Healthcare blue (#0066CC), success green (#10B981), alert red (#EF4444)
- **Large touch targets**: 44px minimum for buttons
- **Bottom sheet modals** for mobile-friendly interactions  
- **Loading states** for map tiles and data fetching
- **Offline messaging** when connectivity lost

## üîÑ **Real-time Logic**
```javascript
// Supabase subscription for live updates
supabase.channel('reports')
  .on('postgres_changes', {event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'reports'}, 
    payload => updateMarkerColors(payload.new))
  .subscribe()

// Confidence calculation
const calculateConfidence = (reports) => {
  const latest = reports[0]
  const hoursOld = (Date.now() - latest.created_at) / (1000 * 60 * 60)
  return Math.max(0, latest.confidence - (hoursOld * 0.0063)) // 0.15/24 hourly decay
}
```

## ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**
- **Marker clustering** for dense pharmacy areas
- **Viewport-based loading** - only load visible pharmacies
- **Debounced search** to prevent excessive API calls
- **Optimistic updates** - show report immediately, sync in background

## üéØ **Success Metrics Dashboard**
Simple admin view (`/admin` with password: "medfinder2024") showing:
- Total reports in last 24h
- Most active pharmacies
- Medication shortage hotspots
- User engagement (reports per session)

**Goal**: Create a production-ready MVP that parents can immediately use to find their child's ADHD medication without calling 10+ pharmacies. Focus on speed, reliability, and mobile usability over fancy features.
